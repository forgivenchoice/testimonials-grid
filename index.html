               I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not
               more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

               “ I was an EMT for many years before I
               joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
               amazing
               experience
               here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
               thereafter.
               The next 12
               weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
               successfully
               switched
               careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

               “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve
               never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
               programming
               step by step.
               I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
               program. The entire
               curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
               assistance. The agile
               team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
               tutorial could ever
               have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.
               It
               certainly
               helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
